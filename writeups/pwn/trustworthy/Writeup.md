## Writeup for challenge 'trustworthy'

This is a experimental task I made since I think Windows is not well-explored in CTF. So you can take this as a movement to encourage CTF players to learn more about Windows. :)

For the challenge description, please see distribution package in [challenge](/challenge/) folder.

The origin of this challenge is a presentation from James Forshaw (see reference).

To explain the logic of `server.exe` roughly : It checks the identification upon client connection, the check is done by enumerating threads in the client process and use `AccessCheck` to check the access from the thread token (if not present, use the primary token) against the security descriptor of `C:\token.txt`.

The intended solution involves using [S4U](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/winsdk/2015/08/28/logon-as-a-user-without-a-password/) mechanism to obtain an IdentificationLevel impersonation token. Note the first hint suggest you about impersonation. (See the API documentation)

For more details, see [solution.cpp](solution.cpp) for more details.
